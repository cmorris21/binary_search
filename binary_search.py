def find_smallest_positive(xs):
    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from LOWEST to HIGHEST.
    Find the index of the smallest positive number.
    If no such index exists, return `None`.

    HINT: 
    This is essentially the binary search algorithm from class,
    but you're always searching for 0.

def count_repeats(xs, x):
    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from HIGHEST to LOWEST,
    and that x is a number.
    Calculate the number of times that x occurs in xs.

    HINT: 
    Use the following three step procedure:
        1) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value >= x
        2) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value < x
        3) return the difference between step 1 and 2

    I highly recommend creating stand-alone functions for steps 1 and 2
    that you can test independently.

def argmin(f, lo, hi, epsilon=1e-3):

    Assumes that f is an input function that takes a float as input and returns a float with a unique global minimum,
    and that lo and hi are both floats satisfying lo < hi.
    Returns a number that is within epsilon of the value that minimizes f(x) over the interval [lo,hi]

    HINT:
    The basic algorithm is:
        1) The base case is when hi-lo < epsilon
        2) For each recursive call:
            a) select two points m1 and m2 that are between lo and hi
            b) one of the 4 points (lo,m1,m2,hi) must be the smallest;
               depending on which one is the smallest, 
               you recursively call your function on the interval [lo,m2] or [m1,hi]
